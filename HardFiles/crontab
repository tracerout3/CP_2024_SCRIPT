# Sample Hardened Crontab File

# Set the PATH variable to a secure, limited set of directories
# This ensures that only trusted executables are used in the cron jobs.
PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

# Limit cron jobs to certain users (this should be configured in the /etc/cron.allow or /etc/cron.deny files)
# Only allow specific trusted users to run cron jobs

# 1. Example Cron Job for a system maintenance task
# Run daily backups at 2:00 AM (adjust command and time as needed)
0 2 * * * root /usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh > /var/log/backup_script.log 2>&1

# 2. Example Cron Job for system security checks
# Run security audit script weekly on Sundays at 3:00 AM
0 3 * * 0 root /usr/local/bin/security_audit.sh > /var/log/security_audit.log 2>&1

# 3. Example Cron Job for clearing temporary files
# Clear /tmp directory every day at 4:00 AM (adjust path based on your system's temp directory)
0 4 * * * root find /tmp -type f -atime +7 -exec rm -f {} \; > /var/log/cleanup_tmp.log 2>&1

# 4. Example Cron Job for monitoring disk space
# Run disk space check every hour
0 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/disk_space_check.sh > /var/log/disk_space_check.log 2>&1

# 5. Example Cron Job for system updates
# Run system update (assuming a package manager like apt or yum) on Sundays at 5:00 AM
0 5 * * 0 root apt update && apt upgrade -y > /var/log/system_update.log 2>&1

# Secure Cron Settings:
# - Ensure the cron service is running securely (root only)
# - Set appropriate permissions on cron jobs and log files (e.g., only allow root to write to cron logs)
# - Use full paths to commands to avoid using unexpected versions of binaries
# - Always redirect output and errors to log files for auditing purposes

# End of hardened crontab file
